For example, McDonald\u2019s restaurants can be found in countries as diverse as Italy, the United States of America, and Bahrain.  Each time a new restaurant is opened, care has to be taken to ensure it is opened in a location that is both geographically and culturally conducive to its success.  For example, it would be a poor business decision to open a burger restaurant in a location that is widely known for practicing veganism. In other words, the financial success of each franchise depends on its location.  Therefore, the financial success of the company as a whole depends on the locations of each of its franchises.  In this project, the neighborhoods in three different cities will be assessed regarding their suitability as locations for a new burger restaurant.  These cities are Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan; and Doha, Qatar.  "
